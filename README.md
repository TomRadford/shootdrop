## What is this?

During pre-production for video/film projects, making gear lists is time-consuming. I created ShootDrop as <strong>a simple, easy-to-use tool to quickly create gear lists</strong>.

## Features

### Drops

A drop is tied to a shoot in the real world, it serves as the home for all gear-related info pertaining to the shoot.

- Collaborators can be added here. They can edit any lists attached to the drops they're on.
- The URL is publically sharable for everyone on the production to stay up to date.
- Overview of all list items - giving you an idea of the shoot at a glance.

### Lists

A list is tied to a drop, it consists of Gear Items in a particular category (either camera, lighting, grips or sound).

- Comments and preferences can be added for each list item.
- _Last edited by_ with time and user to keep track of who added what.

### Gear

- Categories (grips/lighting/camera/sound)
- Tagging for easy filtering. Tags are either generic (eg: cable) or tied to categories (eg: lens or recorder)
- Preferences (eg: Lens Mount or Power Solution)

## Tech

**Web**

- NextJS (React)
- TailwindCSS
- Apollo Client (GraphQL client and state management library)
- Zustand (minimal state management where Apollo reactive variables would be overkill)

**Api**

- NodeJS
- Apollo Server
- MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)
- AWS S3
